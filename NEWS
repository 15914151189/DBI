Version 0.3.0

* `dbGetStatement()`, `dbGetRowsAffected()`, `dbHasCompleted()`, and 
  `dbGetRowCount()` gain default methods that extract the appropriate elements
  from `dbGetInfo()`. This means that most drivers should no longer need to
  implement these methods. (#13)

* New generic `dbIsValid()` returns a logical value describing whether a 
  connection or result set (or other object) is still valid. (#12).

* `dbSetDataMappings()` is deprecated as no working implementation was ever
  provided and it's unlikely to the be the approach we take going forward. (#9)

* `dbFetch()` added as alias to `fetch()` to be consistent with every other
  function in the package. Implementers should define methods for both `fetch()`
  and `dbFetch()` until `fetch()` is deprecated in 2015. For now, the default
  method for `dbFetch()` calls `fetch()`.

* `dbGetQuery()` gains a default method for `DBIConnection` which uses
  `dbSendQuery()`, `fetch()` and `dbClearResult()`.

* `dbDataType()` now uses dispatch on both argument to determine the SQL type
  of an R vector (#5). It also gains a data frame method which returns a vector 
  giving the type of each column.

* `dbGetDBIVersion()` has been deprecated since it's now a thin wrapper
  around `packageVersion().

* DBI has been converted to use roxygen2 for documentation, and now most
  functions have their own documentation files. I would love your feedback
  on how we could make the documentation better!

Version 0.2-7

* Trivial changes (updated package fields, daj)

Version 0.2-6

* Removed deprecated \synopsis in some Rd files (thanks to Prof. Ripley)

Version 0.2-5

* Code cleanups contributed by Matthias Burger: avoid partial argument
  name matching and use TRUE/FALSE, not T/F.

* Change behavior of make.db.names.default to quote SQL keywords if
  allow.keywords is FALSE.  Previously, SQL keywords would be name
  mangled with underscores and a digit.  Now they are quoted using
  '"'.

Version 0.2-4

* Changed license from GPL to LPGL

* Fixed a trivial typo in documentation

Version 0.1-10

* Fixed documentation typos.

Version 0.1-9

* Trivial changes.

Version 0.1-8

* A trivial change due to package.description() being deprecated in 1.9.0.

Version 0.1-7

* Had to do a substantial re-formatting of the documentation
  due to incompatibilities introduced in 1.8.0 S4 method
  documentation. The contents were not changed (modulo fixing 
  a few typos).  Thanks to Kurt Hornik and John Chambers for
  their help.

Version 0.1-6

* Trivial documentation changes (for R CMD check's sake)

Version 0.1-5

* Removed duplicated setGeneric("dbSetDataMappings") 

Version 0.1-4

* Removed the "valueClass" from some generic functions, namely,
  dbListConnections, dbListResults, dbGetException, dbGetQuery,
  and dbGetInfo.  The reason is that methods for these generics
  could potentially return different classes of objects (e.g., 
  the call dbGetInfo(res) could return a list of name-value pairs,
  while dbGetInfo(res, "statement") could be a character vector).

* Added 00Index to inst/doc

* Added dbGetDBIVersion() (simple wrapper to package.description).

Version 0.1-3

* ??? Minor changes?

Version 0.1-2

* An implementation based on version 4 classes and methods.
* Incorporated (mostly Tim Keitt's) comments.
