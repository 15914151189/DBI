\usage{
sqlParseVariables_0.6(conn, sql, ...)

sqlParseVariables_0.5(con, sql, ...)

sqlParseVariables(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{conn, con}{A database connection.}

\item{sql}{A SQL string containing variables to search for.
Variables must start with a question mark and can be any valid R
identifier, i.e. it must start with a letter or \code{.}, and be followed
by a letter, digit, \code{.} or \code{_}.}

\item{...}{Unused.}
}
\description{
Offers a convenient and safe way to determine named placeholders in a SQL query.
This is mostly useful for backend authors where the DBMS doesn't support
parametrized queries.

The signature of this generic has changed from DBI 0.5 to DBI 0.6,
the \code{_0.5} and \code{_0.6} functions are included in the \emph{Usage} section below to
illustrate this change. See the \emph{Compatibility with DBI 0.5} section for
details.
}
\section{Backend authors}{

If you're implementing a backend that uses non-ANSI quoting or commenting
rules, you'll need to implement a method for \code{sqlParseVariables} that
calls \code{sqlParseVariablesImpl} with the appropriate quote and
comment specifications.
}

\section{Compatibility with DBI 0.5}{

In DBI 0.5, the \code{sqlParseVariables()} method had a different signature, see the
\code{_0.5} function in the \emph{Usage} section.
In an effort to harmonize the argument names
across all DBI methods, the current version of DBI encourages backend authors
to define methods with the new \code{_0.6} signature,
which will eventually become the actual signature of the generic.
For technical reasons this is not enforced, the generic is defined with
signature \code{...} and performs nonstandard dispatch to support backends that
implement this method with either signature.

\examples{
# Use [] for quoting and no comments
sqlParseVariablesImpl("[?a]",
  list(sqlQuoteSpec("[", "]", "\\\\", FALSE)),
  list()
)

# Standard quotes, use # for commenting
sqlParseVariablesImpl("# ?a\\n?b",
  list(sqlQuoteSpec("'", "'"), sqlQuoteSpec('"', '"')),
  list(sqlCommentSpec("#", "\\n", FALSE))
)
